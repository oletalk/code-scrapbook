I have completed Task 1 and made a start on Task 2:
- Player, Stock and Tile objects.
- Tests for each.
- A Player can interact with a Stock by drawing a card.

If I had more time, I would complete Task 2:
- draw a full 'hand' of 7 tiles ('deal' method of Stock)
- have more than 1 players
- randomly play tiles just by checking the match
- start to implement a simple strategy for playing tiles
- write a Perldoc
- clean up my tests!
