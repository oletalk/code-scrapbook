  DONE prepend file name with sha1 hash of filehash

  DONE download file into cache
  DONE also trim cache to maxSize
  -- downsample file too, as part of downloadFile (fetch.go)

     -- downsample first and then ServeContent?
     1. on startup, parse command/args from dotenv file
     2. upon each download, run command to generate downsampled file
     3. delete original file (but ensure downsampled file is marked as the cached file)
     4. stream downsampled file
  DONE get file location from hash
  DONE stream file. see https://www.slingacademy.com/article/streaming-large-files-with-go-http/
* don't forget to write tests!
  -- see https://www.gyata.ai/golang/writing-tests
* DONE rest endpoints
  DONE first playlist contents
  DONE then streamed files from cache
  DONE how to find out host header?
